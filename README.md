> #### A little bit about me
>I am a python3.5+ developer. I have a general practical experience in application development and support on The Pyramid Web Framework for more than a year. I am engaged in the development and support of REST API (web backend), database architecture using PostgresSQL DBMS, a little - writing unittests, support of the Apache web service. As well as maintaining code in gitlab and tasks in Jira, parsing xml, ods, odt files, and vice versa, templating in jinja2, and writing documentation a little. As an IDE, Pycharm is convenient, for postgres - pgAdmin in combination with manual additions of tables, databases, records, schemas, writing functions, views, triggers, sequences, etc.

>I try to stick to clean code (flake8 helps) and OOP. I have some experience in multi-threaded, multi-processor and asynchronous programming (asyncio).
>As an additional source of development, I take Skillbox courses as a Python developer (Advanced). I'm actively learning flask. I also dive into deploy and learn how to work with docker.

>I have a higher technical education, as well as knowledge of English at the Upper-Intermediate level (confirmed by IELTS certificate in 2020)
